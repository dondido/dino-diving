When a dino pops up, click or tap on the little chappy to make him dive. Time it right with the waves and wind and your dino lives for another dive. The quicker the dino dives, the more points you get. 
Leave him too long and he'll dive anyway. This game features the following dinosaurs: Albertosaurus, Stegosaurus, Parasaurolophis, Ankylosaurus and Triceraptops.
